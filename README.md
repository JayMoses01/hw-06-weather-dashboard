# hw-06-weather-dashboard by Jay Moses


# Description

I created a weather dashboard with this functionality:
* The user can search for a city and view current and future weather conditions for that city, and each searched city is added to the search history as re-searchable buttons.
* The current weather conditions area displays the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
* The UV index is color-coded based on value.
* A 5-day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
* The user can click on their previously searched cities, which again present the current and future conditions for that city.
